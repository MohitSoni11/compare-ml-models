model_training = '''
Training a machine learning model is critical for achieving good performance and accuracy in tasks such
as classification, regression, and clustering. It involves feeding the model a large amount of data and
adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the error between the predicted output and actual output. 
The choice of training data and the optimization algorithm used can significantly impact the final model
performance. The training process also helps to prevent overfitting, where a model learns the training data
too well and does not generalize well to new data. A well-trained model is essential for making accurate 
predictions and decisions in real-world applications, which is why it is crucial to invest time and resources
in properly training the model.
'''

test_size_text = '''
The test size when splitting data is essential as it determines the portion of the data used for evaluating
the performance of the model. A good test size should be large enough to provide a representative sample
of the data, but not too large that it leaves limited data for training the model. A common practice is to 
split the data into training and test sets, with a commonly used ratio of 70:30 or 80:20. So, if you are not
sure of what you want to enter for the test size, consider entering 20 or 30.
